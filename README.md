### Live
Visit [portfolio-photographer-app.vercel.app](https://portfolio-photographer-app.vercel.app) to see it. Application is deployed to Vercel's frontend cloud.

The main idea is to give end user fast response so preference was given to SSG where it was possible. It was also provided opportunity to admin to manage content at the same application. 
End users should not see any admin's items. 

#### To sign in as admin:
- go to `sign-in` (type manually into browser url string)
- enter **email** `portfolio@gmail.com` and password `123456`

P.S. It is allowed to add/edit/delete everything but please do not delete a lot of content ðŸ˜Š
